    Custom HTTP client for Anthropic's Claude API.

    This implementation uses raw HTTP requests (requests/aiohttp) instead of
    the official SDK, demonstrating how to interact with Claude's API directly
    and handle its Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming format.
    """

    def response(self, messages: list[Message], **kwargs) -> Message:
        """
        Get a synchronous response using raw HTTP POST request.

        Args:
            messages (list[Message]): The conversation history.
            **kwargs: Additional parameters like max_tokens (default: 1024).

        Returns:
            Message: The AI's response message.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the API response contains no content blocks.
            Exception: If the HTTP request fails (non-200 status code).

        Note:
            Requires 'x-api-key' header and 'anthropic-version' header.
            Claude's API returns content as an array of content blocks.
            The response is printed to stdout before being returned.
